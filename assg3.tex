	\textbf{Example 10:}
	 Fifty seeds were selected at random from each of 5 bags of seeds, and
were kept under standardised conditions favourable to germination. After 20 days, the number of seeds which had germinated in each collection were counted and recorded as follows:\\

What is the probability of germination of
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
    \item more than $40$ seeds in a bag $?$
 	\item $49$ seeds in a bag $?$
 	\item more than $35$ seeds in a bag $?$
    \end{enumerate}
    
	% The answer
	\textbf{Solution.}
	Let a random variable $X \in [0,50]$ where $X \in \mathbb{Z}$, denote the number of seeds germinated in a bag. Also, let $n(X = k)$ denote the number of bags in which number of seeds germinated $=k$.

	\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
    \item The probability of germination of more than $40$ seeds in a bag:
	\begin{align}
	\pr{X > 40} &= \dfrac{n(X>40)}{n(X>40) + n(X\le40)} \\
	&= \dfrac{3}{3+2} \\
	&= \dfrac{3}{5} \\
	&= 0.6
	\end{align}
	$\therefore$ The probability of germination of more than $40$ seeds in a bag is $0.6$
	
	\item The probability of germination of $49$ seeds in a bag:
	\begin{align}
	\pr{X = 40} &= \dfrac{n(X=49)}{n(X=49) + n(X \neq 49)} \\
	&= \dfrac{0}{0+5} \\
	&= \dfrac{0}{5}   \\
	&= 0
	\end{align}
	$\therefore$ The probability of germination of $49$ seeds in a bag is $0.0$
	
	\item The probability of germination of more than $35$ seeds in a bag:
	\begin{align}
	\pr{X > 40} &= \dfrac{n(X>35)}{n(X>35) + n(X\le35)} \\
	&= \dfrac{5}{5+0} \\
	&= \dfrac{5}{5}  \\
	&= 1.0
	\end{align}
	$\therefore$ The probability of germination of more than $35$ seeds in a bag is $1.0$
	
	\end{enumerate}
